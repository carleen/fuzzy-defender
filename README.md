# fuzzy-defender
Using fuzzy logic in a simulated network for cyberattack detection and identification

All dependencies are contained in `requirements.txt`. 

To test code, run `python run_simulation.py`. Output will be generated in a 
`results` folder. The current simulation creates a `.csv` file of results
for all nodes in a `compromised` and `uncompromised` network. The 
`compromised` network shows the result of network performance for a 
node which has been compromised by an attacker.
